# acecursor
Just a little tool that remaps the keyboard bindings for moving the cursor up, down, left, right to standard Vim-bindings key conventions but different in the fact that it does not need "mode switching". Just press CapsLock + (H/J/K/L). Capslock is remapped to Ctrl+Shift with the help of ahk.
This prolly does not make sense for the experience Vim user, but for a programmer like me, who is completely unfamiliar with Vim Bindings and hates having to reach for the arrow keys to move the mouse cursor, its possibly helpful!
The ext also provides vscode actions for moving the cursor to the neartest "{" and "}",  mapped to Capslock + (F/G) respectively with Capslock obviously being remapped to Ctrl+Shift using ahk.
Im not gonna put this on the marketplace. you gotta clone the repo and build the ext for yourself. This is mostly built for the solving the extremely super niche use case that prolly only I have 😅
